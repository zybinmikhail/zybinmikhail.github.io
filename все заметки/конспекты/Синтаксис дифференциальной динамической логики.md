 Note that the syntax of the differential dynamic logic dL given here uses slightly simplified notation in comparison to the notation in KeYmaera X, which uses more escaping of mathematical characters in ASCII.

Sheet
Formulas of dL, with typical names φ and ψ, are defined by the following syntax
φ ::= 	\forall x φ 	Universal quantifier: for all real values of x, formula φ holds
	\exists x φ 	Existential quantifier: for some real value of x, formula φ holds
	[α] φ	After all runs of hybrid program α, formula φ holds (safety)
	<α> φ	There is at least one run of hybrid program α, after which formula φ holds (liveness)
	!φ	Negation (not)
	φ & ψ	Conjunction (and)
	φ | ψ	Disjunction (or)
	φ -> ψ	Implication (implication)
	φ <-> ψ	Biimplication (equivalence)
	pred 	Real arithmetic predicate expression

The behavior of the hybrid system α is specified as a hybrid program, which is, essentially, a program notation for hybrid systems.
Hybrid programs, with typical names α and β, are defined by the following syntax
α ::= 	α; β	Sequential composition following β after α has finished
	α ++ β	Nondeterministic choice following either α or β
	α* 	Nondeterministic repetition, repeating α arbitrarily often including 0 times
	x:=t 	Discrete assignment/jump assigning the value of t to x
	{x'=t,y'=s, Q} 	Continuous evolution along differential equation system with terms t,s, optionally with evolution domain constraint Q. Systems of differential equations, differential-algebraic equations, and differential equations with disturbances are possible as well.
	?Q 	State assertion testing whether formula Q is true in current state (otherwise abort)
where H is a formula of (possibly non-linear) real arithmetic.
