*Why do you want to work at CHAI as opposed to other research labs?*

The values and mission of CHAI are very close to mine. I want to do as much good as I can, and I believe that the far future of humanity is important, therefore I would like fo focus on reducing existential risks for our civilization. I believe that the creation of strong AI will completely change the shape of our history, even more than agricultural and industrial revolutions. I think that by participating in the internship I will gain a lot of career capital in research and increase my capacity.

*What are you hoping to achieve from the internship? For example, are you seeking to improve certain research skills, contribute to a publication, test out whether AI research is a good fit for your career, or something else?*

My goals are to gain research experience, understand which part of AI research is most interesting for me, build meaningful connections with other people with similar values. I want to make a tangile contribution to the work of CHAI because of its great mission.


*What are your research interests in AI? For example, are you interested in RL, theory, adversarial policies, etc? *

I am currently doing research on safe RL methods using formal verification. My interests include RL, logic, statistics and probability theory, control theory and application of ML in physics. I did my bachelor thesis on the topic "Machine Learning Approach to Search for Patters in Physical Phenomena", where me and my team tried to capture and model how scientists make experiments and infer the natural laws from the obtained data.

*Do you have a specific research idea or project that you want to work on during your internship? It is OK if you do not, and there is no guarantee you will be able to work on a project related to your proposal, but this may help us match you with a mentor with similar research interests. *

Probably, yes. Human brains are able to form concepts becasue when they perceive similar information, then similar neurons fire, and as time goes by these neurons connect to each other (because of the "fire-wire" rule), and the new concept gets formed. I wonder whether it is possible to create an artificial structure, that would also be capable of forming concepts in a similar way. Is it possuble to create a structure that would be malleable enough to form concepts just by making observations?
