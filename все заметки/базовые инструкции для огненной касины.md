1. 1. Stare at a candle flame or other light source (e.g. the led lamp from your smartphone (be careful not to hurt yourself)). Try to minimise
blinking and eye movement.
2. 2. Close your eyes, focus on the afterimage.
3. 3. When the afterimage vanishes, bring it back.
4. 4. Has it come back after having vanished? Has it changed color or shape
even if just by a little bit? If yes, congratulations! You are now in
some very light form of access concentration: You are meditating on a
mentally created image, rather than the original stimulus that your
retina received from the light, or its direct, physical after-effect on
it.
5. 5. Play with it.
6. 6. If it vanished irreparably, and it doesn't come back, go back to (1) and repeat.
