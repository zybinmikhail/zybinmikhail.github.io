Chapter 1 What This Book Is About
To complain about a shortage of time is like a fish in the sea complaining that it has a shortage of water.
Chapter 2 The Principles
A clear vision is as much about what you are not going to do as it is about what you are going to do.
    1. Have a clear vision 
    2. One thing at a time 
    3. Little and often 
    4. Limits 
    5. Closed lists 
    6. Reduce randomness 
    7. Commitment v. interest 
    8. What do we need? 
Chapter 3 Creative, Ordered and Effective
Being well ordered has little to do with character; it has everything to do with how your life is structured.
Effectiveness = Creativity x Order
Chapter 4 The Problem with Time Management
Just because something would be nice to eat, doesn’t mean you have to eat it.
    1. We are working inefficiently. 
    2. We have too much to do. 
    3. We have too little time to do it in. 
Chapter 5 Real Work v. Busy Work
Busy work often looks more like work than real work does.
Chapter 6  Emergency, What Emergency?
A pseudo-emergency is one that is an emergency only because you have not done it earlier.
three degrees of urgency:
    • Immediate; 
    • Same day; 
    • Tomorrow. 
Chapter 7 Closed Lists
A closed list is a way of applying limits to our work in order to increase our efficiency.
Chapter 8 The Mañana Principle
The art of getting everything done by putting it off to tomorrow.
Avoid actioning things the same day whenever possible. Make maximum use of closed lists.
Summary of the mañana principle
    • Collect one day’s work and action it the following day. Action it in batches of related actions, e.g. email, voicemail, paper, tasks. 
    • Collect incoming paper in Tray A during the day. Then transfer it to Tray B for action the next day. 
    • Write down incoming tasks under tomorrow’s date in a page-a-day diary (‘task diary’). 
    • Draw a line at the end of today closing off tomorrow’s list in the task diary. 
    • Write any ‘same-day’ items into your task diary below the line on today’s date for action at a suitable moment today. 
Chapter 9 Task Diary
You will never get anyone to attach a higher priority to your work than they perceive you are giving to it yourself.
Chapter 10 Current Initiative
It is surprising how easy it is to forget that the way to get things done is to do them.
    1. You need to do something 
    2. You need to do it every day 
    3. You need to do it first 
Chapter 11 Will Do v. To Do
Each and every day our aim is to cross off every item from the list.
The to-do list is an open list of things that we might do during the day. What we really need is a closed list of things that we will do during the day
Chapter 12 Completing the Day’s Work
If you are one of those people who claim you work best under stress, then you probably suffer from low processing power.
Traditional time management methods do not tell us how to measure, whether we've done "everything" or not.
Get more focused and concentrated.
Reduce number of commitment - prioritizing doesn't help.
Chapter 13 Keeping Going
Lying is an attribute of the rational mind.
Procrastination is mainly caused by the feeling overwhelmed by huge amount of job. Natural response to threat is paralysis.
Working in bursts is very useful. You may start from five minutes, if there is a specially strong resistance to do the task, and then gradually make burst longer. Important part is to take breaks, however abrupt they seem. Breaks refresh you and give a sense of completion.
Have fixed time for lunch break and fixed time for finishing all daily work.
It is a useful technique to fool your system 1 by pretending to to only the first step of an unpleasant task.
    • I'm not really going to blah-blah 
    • I'll just blah-blah 
    • I'll do it later 
Chapter 14 More on Dealing with Projects
I don’t believe that anyone consistently prioritises by importance because it’s virtually impossible to do so.
    • Continuous projects
      Some similar actions repeated over long period of time. Not suitable for current initiative.
    • Organisational projects
      Series of different actions leading to a specific goal. Goal is rather a point, not the actions.
Prioritising projects – doing the least urgent things first
When people talk about how urgent something is, they are generally including two completely different things: Things that are urgent because they really are urgent in themselves (e.g. evacuating a building when it’s on fire, getting a front-page scoop ready for the next edition). Things that are urgent only because they haven’t been done earlier (e.g. getting the report we have been putting off finished by the deadline).
Useful tips for delegating tasks (although they seem to be quite useful on their own)
    • Never sit on work – delegate it as soon as possible 
    • Allow a buffer when setting a deadline 
    • Be specific 
    • Give intermediate deadlines 
    • Remind before a deadline 
    • Follow up immediately 
    • Don’t listen to excuses 
Chapter 15 Sorting Out Systems
The time you spend on systems is seldom wasted, and usually repays itself thousands of times over.
When you are working you do nothing but work; when you are not working you do anything but work!
It is useful to arrange files in a way that you put a file on the left side or on the top so they are sorted in the "last used" order.
Chapter 16 Conclusion
Few things are so urgent that they wouldn’t be better put off till tomorrow.
