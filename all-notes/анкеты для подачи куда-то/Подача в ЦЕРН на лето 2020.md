  - Scientific achievements
  - Several important achievements in particle physics have been made through experiments at CERN. They include:
    - 1973: The discovery of neutral currents in the Gargamelle bubble chamber;[12]
    - 1983: The discovery of W and Z bosons in the UA1 and UA2 experiments;[13]
    - 1989: The determination of the number of light neutrino families at the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP) operating on the Z boson peak;
    - 1995: The first creation of antihydrogen atoms in the PS210 experiment;[14]
    - 1999: The discovery of direct CP violation in the NA48 experiment;[15]
    - 2010: The isolation of 38 atoms of antihydrogen;[16]
    - 2011: Maintaining antihydrogen for over 15 minutes;[17]
    - 2012: A boson with mass around 125 GeV/c2 consistent with the long-sought Higgs boson.

          - ATLAS is a general-purpose experiment for recording proton-proton collisions at LHC. The ATLAS collaboration consists of 144 participating institutions (June 1998) with more than 1750 physicists and engineers (700 from non-Member States). The detector design has been optimized to cover the largest possible range of LHC physics: searches for Higgs bosons and alternative schemes for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism; searches for supersymmetric particles, new gauge bosons, leptoquarks, and quark and lepton compositeness indicating extensions to the Standard Model and new physics beyond it; studies of the origin of CP violation via high-precision measurements of CP-violating B-decays; high-precision measurements of the third quark family such as the top-quark mass and decay properties, rare decays of B-hadrons, spectroscopy of rare B-hadrons, and B0s-mixing. The ATLAS dectector, shown in the Figure includes an inner tracking detector inside a 2 T solenoid providing an axial field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters outside the solenoid and in the forward regions, and barrel and end-cap air-core-toroid muon spectrometers. The precision measurements for photons, electrons, muons and hadrons, and identification of photons, electrons, muons, τ-leptons and b-quark jets are performed over |η| < 2.5. The complete hadronic energy measurement extends over |η| < 4.7.
          - The inner tracking detector consists of straw drift tubes interleaved with transition radiators for robust pattern recognition and electron identification, and several layers of semiconductor strip and pixel detectors providing high-precision space points.
          - The e.m. calorimeter is a lead-Liquid Argon sampling calorimeter with an integrated preshower detector and a presampler layer immediately behind the cryostat wall for energy recovery. The end-cap hadronic calorimeters also use Liquid Argon technology, with copper absorber plates. The end-cap cryostats house the e.m., hadronic and forward calorimeters (tungsten-Liquid Argon sampling). The barrel hadronic calorimeter is an iron-scintillating tile sampling calorimeter with longitudinal tile geometry.
          - Air-core toroids are used for the muon spectrometer. Eight superconducting coils with warm voussoirs are used in the barrel region complemented with superconducting end-cap toroids in the forward regions. The toroids will be instrumented with Monitored Drift Tubes (Cathode Strip Chambers at large rapidity where there are high radiation levels). The muon trigger and second coordinate measurement for muon tracks are provided

      - Add links to your LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and website. This is not mandatory but if you decide to put in the links, make sure that you updated and polished your accounts;

      - лучше ничего не писать в message to a hiring manager
    - что потом
      - The following few questions are self-explanatory. Here, they will ask you for additional personal information (date of birth, gender, nationality) and languages you speak. They ask you about your knowledge of English and French. They do not ask you for a language certificate. You basically rate yourself. Here is a small piece of advice: Do not lie! Some supervisors have complained about students lying about their language skills and this is certainly not a very good first impression.
      - Then, you have to state your main field of studies.
      - Мотивационное письмо
        - <= 1440 символов
        - самая важная штука
        - https://taubytes.com/cern/2018-11-23-motivationletter.html
      - select a domain from the given list, which, in your opinion, “you have sufficient experience and/or knowledge to make an operational contribution”. The two following sections are also very important: you are asked to elaborate on the domain you have chosen in the previous step and to give interest in any specific topics. на каждый 1440 символов
      - you are asked to tell them which operating systems, programming languages and databases you are familiar with. You will be asked to provide details:
        - Did you have lessons on it?
        - What amount of code you wrote?
        - Did you complete any projects?
      - Now, you just have to answer a few questions about CERN (if you worked there, how long you want to stay and in what period) and attach any documents they ask for, e.g. an academic transcript. 
  - Что делать, если взяли (спойлер: радоваться)
