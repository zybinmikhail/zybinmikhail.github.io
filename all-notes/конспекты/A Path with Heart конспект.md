# Part I A Path with Heart: The Fundamentals

## A Beginning

*In beginning this book I have emphasized my own personal journey, because the greatest lesson I have learned is that the universal must be wedded to the personal to be fulfilled in our spiritual life.*

In 1972 author returned to America after 5-year study in Asia. Although he practised and studied a lot, he discovered he still had problems in personal life. He hoped to leave behind pains and difficulties, but they are, in fact, part of practise, too. 

1976 - completed PhD in clinical psychology and worked ever since as a psychotherapist as well as a Buddhist teacher

we need a very brave heart not to run from our life

## Chapter 1 Did I love well

*Even the most exalted states and the most exceptional spiritual accomplishments are unimportant if we cannot be happy in the most basic and ordinary ways, if we cannot touch one another and the life we have been given with our heart.*

*We must make certain that our path is connected with our heart.*

## Chapter 2 Stopping the war

*When we step out of the battles, we see anew, as the* Tao te Ching *says, "with eyes unclouded by longing".*

## Chapter 3 Take the One Seat

## Chapter 4 Necessary Healing

## Chapter 5 Training the Puppy: Mindfulness of Breathing

# Part II Promises and Perils

## Chapter 6 Turning Straw into Gold

## Chapter 7 Naming the Demons

## Chapter 8 Difficult Problems and Insistent Visitors

*When any experience of body, heart, or mind keeps repeating in consciousness, it is a signal that this visitor is asking for a deeper and fuller attention.*

Sankaras - repeated difficulties, painful sensations, thoughts, feelings, and stories that arise in our consciousness.

"Not just sit there like an idiot"

general rule of meditation: stay open to the flow of whatever arises

### Expand the field of attention

You can give specific names or numbers to recurring patterns of thought, if they do not vanish after noticing them.

Body, feelings, thoughts, mental objects.

### A full awareness of the feelings

For many meditators, reclaiming an awareness of their feelings is a long and difficult process.

Become free to feel each feeling and let it move on.

### Discover what is asking for acceptance

### Open through the centre

Story about a man who broke an arm of someone while playing football at the age of 16.

We often mistake our small identities for ourselves. This is limiting. Spiritual practise learns us to release ourselves from needy, fearful, or compulsive identities.

### Five more skilful means

- Letting go. Don't mix it with aversion.
- Let it go, Let it be
- Transforming the energy
    - external
    - internal
- Putting aside
    - dealing with problems and spiritual growth need proper time and place
- Acting mindfully and in imagination
- Enacting mindfully

## Chapter 9 The Spiritual Roller Coaster: Kundalini and other Side Effects

*The dazzling effect of lights and visions, the powerful releases of rapture and energy are a wonderful sign of the breakdown of the old structures of our being, body, and mind. However, they do not in themselves produce wisdom.*

### Attitudes Toward Altered States

Some schools emphasize powerful experience of self-transcendence and awakening, such as Rinzai Zen, vipassana, Dark Night prayer, Raja and kundalini yogas.

Other schools emphasize on realization here and now, such as Soto Zen.

Suzuki Roshi never spoke of satori. All altered states in Soto are ignored. Advaita Vedanta, Krishnamurti, karma yoga.

Immanent and transcendent paths.

Attachment to visions and experiences is dangerous.

### Some Common Altered States

- Raptures
    - heat, pulsations, vibrations, spontaneous movements
    - increasing or decreasing temperature
    - colored lights: blues, greens, purples, then golden and white
    - earth (hardness-softness), air (vibration), fire (temperature), water (cohesiveness)
    - absolutely crazy stuff
- Chakras
    - Kundalini is one of the best descriptions of energy release

### Skillful means of Working with the Energetic and Emotional Openings

- All spiritual phenomena are side effects
- Finding the brake

## Chapter 10 Expanding and Dissolving the Self: Dark Night and Rebirth

*When we finally look at horror and joy, birth and death, gain and loss, things, with equal heart and open mind, there arises a most beautiful and profound equanimity.*

# Searching for the Buddha: A Lamp into Ourselves

*When we are faced with a variety of spiritual teachings and practices, we must keep a genuine sense of inquiry. What is the effect of these teachings and practices on myself and others? In his last words, the Buddha said we must be a lamp into ourselves.*

We must discover our own way.

put aside all the teaching you've heard and consider what you yourself truly know

Our spiritual life becomes unshakable only when we are connected with our own realization of truth.

It is not perfection we must seek, but freedom of the heart.

# Part III Widening our Circle

## Chapter 12 Accepting the Cycles of Spiritual Life

*If we have ideas about how our practice should unfold, these will often get in the way, preventing us from honoring the phase that is actually with us.*

Spiritual life is not linear journey. 

We should honor the cycles that constitute our life.

We need to listen to what cycle are we currently in. What are specific seeds of spiritual development present in this cycle?

Include all cycles in your practice with attention, love and acceptance.

Transition from retreat to daily live might be a tough process, which has to be done gradually and mindfully.

## Chapter 13 No Boundaries to the Sacred

*The compartments we create to shield us from what we fear, ignore, and exclude exact their toll later in life. Periods of holiness and spiritual fervor can later alternate with opposite extremes - binding on food, sex, and other things - becoming a kind of spiritual bulimia. Spiritual practice will not save us from suffering and confusion, it only allows us to understand that avoidance of pain does not help.*

Sacred and secular should not be divided.

Near enemies

loving kindness - attachment

compassion - pity

sympathetic joy - comparison

equanimity - indifference

Spiritual practice will not save us from suffering and confusion, it only allows us to understand that avoidance of pain does not help.

We must see that spirituality is continuous movement away from compartmentalization and separation and toward embracing all life.

## Chapter 14 No Self or True Self?

*There are two parallel tasks in spiritual life. One is to discover selflessness, the other is to develop a healthy sense of self. Both sides of that apparent paradox must be fulfilled for us to awaken.*

The belief in small individual self is the root illusion that causes our suffering.

Sense if self arises out of identification with one of five skandhas: processes of the physical body, feelings, perceptions, responses, flow of consciousness.

All experience arises in the present, does its dance, and disappear.

Empty, in this sense, means full of everything.

No amount of self-denial or self-torture can rid us of a self, for it was never there.

Emptiness is sometimes misunderstood and deadness, numbness, or meaninglessness.

The first level of self-development for many students is reclamation.

## Chapter 15 Generosity, Codependence, and Fearless Compassion

*When our sense of self-worth is still low, we cannot set limits, make boundaries, or respect our own needs. Our seemingly compassionate assistance becomes mixed with dependence, fear, and insecurity. Mature love and healthy compassion are not dependent but interdependent, born out of a deep respect for ourselves as well for others.*

Compassionate generosity is the foundation of true spiritual life because it is the practice of letting go.

Codependence is unhealthy and arises from not well-developed sense of self.

There exist a problem of forgetting one's own needs, staying disconnected from one's own role in relations.

The ground for compassion is established first by developing sensitivity toward ourselves.

True compassion arises from a sense that the heart has the fearless capacity to embrace all things, to touch all things, to relate to all things.

## Chapter 17 Psychotherapy and Meditation

*The best of modern therapy is much like a process of shared meditation, where therapist and client sit together, learning to pay close attention to those aspects and dimensions of the self that the client may be unable to touch on his or her own.*

All too often the mistaken belief that enough sincere practice of prayer or meditation is all that is needed to transform their lives has prevented teachers and students from making use of the helpful teachings of Western psychology.

## Chapter 18 The Emperor's New Clothes: Problems with Teachers

*In general these problems arise when spirituality ignores or denies our own humanity.*

*As far as Buddha Nature is concerned, there is no difference between sinner and sage... One enlightened thougtht and one is a Buddha, one foolish thought and one is an ordinary person.*

### Naming the difficulties

- misuse of power
    - "us against them" isolationism
- money
- harm through sexuality
- addiction to alcohol or drugs

## Chapter 19: The Heart is our Garden

*The heart is our garden, and along with each action there is an intention that is planted like a seed. We can use a sharp knife to cut someone, and if our intention is to do harm, we will be a murderer. We can perform an almost identical action, but if we are a surgeon, the intention is to heal and save life. The action is the same, yet depending on its purpose or intention, it can be either a terrible act or a compassionate act.*

We often act because of our bad habits. Everything has its cause.

Our personalities are often driven by desire, aversion or delusion.

We do not need to get rid of it, but understand our body and mind.

We die every moment and we are reborn the next.

weighty, proximate, habitual, random karma

causative, sustaining, counteractive, destructive karma

pay close attention to your intentions

Through intentions we can shape or direct the patterns of our heart or mind.

## Chapter 20: Expanding our circle: an Undivided Heart

*Suppose you considered your neighborhood to be your temple - how would you treat your temple, and what would be your spiritual task here?*

Being on earth here in human bodies, this year, this day, is our spiritual practice.
